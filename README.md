# Quality-Prediction
Prediction refers to the output of an algorithm after it has been trained on a historical dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome, such as whether or not a customer will churn in 30 days. The algorithm will generate probable values for an unknown variable for each record in the new data, allowing the model builder to identify what that value will most likely be.

Prediction is about fitting a shape that gets as close to the data as possible.
